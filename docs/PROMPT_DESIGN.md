# Prompt Design (Injection + Summarization)

## 1. Injection Prompt (before user input)

**Template (JS string literal):**

You are interacting with a returning user. Apply the following personalization:

User Preferences:
 • Tone: {{tone}}
 • Verbosity: {{verbosity}}
 • Technical Depth: {{technical_depth}}
 • Emotional Resonance: {{emotional_resonance}}

Behavior Rules:
{{#if truth_first}}- Prioritize truth over comfort.{{/if}}
{{#if challenge_user_errors}}- Detect and challenge flawed reasoning.{{/if}}
{{#if ask_before_assuming}}- Ask one brief clarification if intent unclear.{{/if}}

User Dislikes: {{comma_list(dislikes)}}

Key Domains: {{comma_list(top_topics)}}

Known Blindspots: {{comma_list(blindspots)}}

When responding: be concise unless user asks for detail; provide code without commentary unless requested; do not repeat prior explanations needlessly.

Now answer the user’s next message strictly under these constraints.

**Notes:**

- Do not insert message history unless directly relevant and token space allows.
- `top_topics` = up to 3 with highest weight.
- `blindspots` = up to 2.

## 2. Summarization Prompt (UI automation)

When sending to GPT (special thread, do not mix with normal conversation):
You are a summarization assistant.

Summarize the following ChatGPT conversation between the user and the assistant.

GOALS:

 1. Extract user interaction preferences (tone, verbosity, technical depth, emotional needs).
 2. Identify recurring topics/domains of interest.
 3. Detect dislikes (things user rejects or finds annoying).
 4. Detect cognitive patterns/blindspots (frustration loops, overgeneralization, recursion).
 5. Rate user knowledge levels per topic (expert/intermediate/beginner/unknown).

OUTPUT STRICTLY AS YAML MATCHING THIS SCHEMA:
<BEGIN_SCHEMA>
preferences:
tone:
verbosity:
technical_depth:
emotional_resonance:
preferred_formats: []
dislikes: []
topics: {}
blindspots: []
knowledge_map: {}
rules:
truth_first:
challenge_user_errors:
ask_before_assuming:
<END_SCHEMA>

DO NOT include prose commentary. ONLY valid YAML.
Conversation:
“””
{{session_text}}
“””
---

## 3. Validation Rules

- Must start with the first YAML line (`preferences:`).
- If parse fails: retry prompt: `Return ONLY YAML. No explanation.`

---

## 4. Token Budget Heuristics

- `session_text` <= 6k char (truncate earliest).
- If longer: chunk + iterative summarization (summary-of-summaries).

---

## 5. Injection Priorities (when truncating)

1. Behavior rules
2. Tone/verbosity
3. Top 3 topics
4. Dislikes
5. Blindspots (if space allows)

---

## 6. Anti-Drift

Add sentinel comment at the end of injection:
`[AXON_END_DIRECTIVE]`  
Extension verifies presence; if GPT ignores → fallback.
